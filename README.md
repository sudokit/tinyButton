# tinyButton
A really simple button libary for TinyGo. I needed a simple button library for TinyGo projects, and i really liked the JC_Button library for aduino. So i decided to try translating it to Go.
So full credit goes to: [JChristensen](https://github.com/JChristensen) and his awesome and simple [JC_Button](https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button) library.

ps. idk how this licensing works so mb if i violated any stuff. lmk and ill make this repo private :p

The code may be/is really bad. This was my first Go "project".
